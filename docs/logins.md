# Finding Logins

Places to look for logins to GoDaddy, Hostgator, WordPress, etc:

## In-office shared server:
- command + k, connect to `smb://192.168.0.254` with no credentials. The graphic designers know how to access this server. Once there, go to the "Website Logins" and refer to the .txt files there for logins

## Basecamp:
- If you can't find it on the server, try looking in Basecamp under "Think Tank HQ" -> "Docs and Files" - these logins are private to ThinkTank and not shared with clients.

## LastPass:
- Some logins may be stored in LastPass, so try searching there.

## Message Kevin or Trish:
- They might have it in an old email or something.

## FileZilla:
- Some FTP connections to Staging and Live sites are saved in FileZilla's Site Manager on Josh's computer. File -> Site Manager

## For WordPress "hacking"
- If you need to get into WordPress but don't know how, use CPanel to add a database user, WordPress CLI to reset the admin password, etc
