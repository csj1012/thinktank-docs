# How to do an Eblast

> Dave traditionally does these, but if he's not available, here's how!

- Download the graphic or otherwise get it from someone. Make sure the images are no wider than 600px.
- This is creating an image map in Dreamweaver, so do that
  - Select the image in Dreamweaver
  - Use "hot boxes" to place image map areas and link them up with the links from Basecamp
  - Make the "selectable" areas larger because most people are looking at it on their phone
- Create a campaign in Mailchimp and enter the title and paste in (?) the HTML/JS from Dreamweaver
  - Sign into Mailchimp as the client account (logins on Basecamp "Docs & Files" or the individual client project)
  - Go to "Campaigns"
  - Replicate an existing campaign if one exists; otherwise create a new campaign
  - Enter the subject in the Campaign Title, Subject Line, and Campaign URL fields
  - Click "Edit Design"
    - Grab an "Image BLock" and drag it into the editor
    - Upload the image (original image that accompanies the image map you created in Dreamweaver)
    - Select the image (checked), "View Details," and copy the URL
    - Remove the Image Block
    - Highlight the image that's already there so you can replace the path by going to the "Source" button in the editor
    - Grab the `img` and `map` elements from Dreamweaver and paste them into the editor, using the correct uploaded-to-Mailchimp image path from the previous step
  - Go to "review and test"
    - Send a test email to yourself, the reporter, and whoever else is on the list
    - Respond on Basecamp accordingly - sometimes the test email doesn't go out to everyone it should, so check with the recipients before you post on Basecamp
  - Once you know everything looks good, schedule the mail:
    - Edit the Recipients or check to make sure that they look good (some clients' will change, most won't)
    - Fill out the time, etc. and then schedule the things
    - Notify the person who assigned the task to you
    - Double check the mail and make sure it's good before the scheduled time arrives
